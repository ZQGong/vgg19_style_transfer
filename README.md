% "VGG" stands for the Oxford Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford, which is part of the Robotics Research Group, founded in 1985, and whose research ranges from machine learning to mobile robotics.

About the Project - 
--------------------
This project implements the algorithm found in [(Gatys 2016)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).

Libraries required - 
--------------------
The model is mainly based on the pytorch framework, and the torch and torchvision libraries need to be installed. The image data is imported using the PIL library.
