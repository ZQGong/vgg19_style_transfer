About the Project - 
--------------------
This project implements the algorithm found in [(Gatys 2016)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).

Libraries required - 
--------------------
The model is mainly based on the pytorch framework, and the torch and torchvision libraries need to be installed. The image data is imported using the PIL library.
